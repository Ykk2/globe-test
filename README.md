## Description

I always wanted to go out into space but it is a previlege reserved for the few. So instead I created a space of my own. 


## How to get started

Make sure you have node installed. 

Clone this repository.

At the root directory run 

```bash
npm install 
```
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Current Features

Users can explore around by using 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to move forward, rotate left, rotate right, and move backwards. 
<br><br>'O' and 'L' keys are used to pitch up and down. 

## Upcoming Features

More planets! I am looking to add the moon first, and the remaining planets. 

Realistic cloud movements around Earth. 

Multiplayer interaction via sockets and spaceship models to indicate other users. 

## Things I'm currently working on

Implementing boundary logic for planets, space, and user.

Looking for spaceship assets.

Tweaking atmosphere shaders to have greater glow and gradient effect from surface to end.
